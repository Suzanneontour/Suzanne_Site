		<h1>Suzanne Shrekgast</h1>
 		<p class="AboutIntro">About: Originally from Connecticut, currently living on the <strong>Upper East Side</strong> of Manhattan (so close to the DiBlasio's!). I love dogs, furniture design, photography, and film. And I'm planning to make a GREAT site in this FEWD class, but Javascript is intimidating me from not so far away.

      <p>Earlier this summer, I was inspired to write this:<br>
        I've received some good advice this summer, but on the spectrum of helpfulness, two particular pieces of wisdom have come from the polar opposite ends.
        In June, one of my oldest and closest friends, who is, coincidentally, the furthest away geographically, urged me to 
        <span style="font-size:30px">
        "just let a good thing be."</span> I <strong>loved</strong> it, vowed to remember what she said every day and, for the most part, I've been successful in that pursuit.</p>
        <p>Then in August, another friend who lives just a few blocks away from me, doled out some real truth when she stared directly at me and said quite bluntly, <span style="font-size:30px">"Suzanne, bitches be crazy."</span> Again, I loved it and I saw the truth in her statement. Both friends - unique in their perspectives and dear to my heart - certainly gave me a lot to think about at different points this summer.</p>
        <p>For now, I'm just trying to keep an open mind and surround myself with good people near and far.</p></div>
